:information_source: **Note:** This project is created purely for **educational purposes** and as a **personal challenge**. It's a custom-built implementation of the .NET Dependency Injection Framework by Microsoft. 

:warning: **Warning:** While it serves as a great exploration of dependency injection principles, I wouldn't recommend using it in a production environment.
